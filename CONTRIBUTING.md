# Contributions Welcome

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Cloud Runner! This resource is a simple project, but has plenty of room for improvement.

If you're just looking for quick feedback for an idea or proposal, feel free to open an
[issue](https://github.com/homedepot/cloud-runner/issues/new).

Follow the [contribution workflow](#contribution-workflow) for submitting your
changes to the Cloud Runner codebase.

## Contribution Workflow

The Cloud Runner repository uses the “fork-and-pull” development model. Follow these steps if
you want to merge your changes to the Cloud Runner repository:

1. Within your fork of 
   [Cloud Runner](https://github.com/homedepot/cloud-runner), create a
   branch for your contribution. Use a meaningful name.
2. Create your contribution, meeting all
   [contribution quality standards](#contribution-quality-standards)
3. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)
   against the main branch of the Cloud Runner repository.
4. Add a reviewer to your pull request. Work with your reviewer to address any comments and obtain an approval.
   To update your pull request amend existing commits whenever applicable and
   then push the new changes to your pull request branch.
5. Once the pull request is approved, one of the [maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md). will merge it.

## Contribution Quality Standards

Your contribution needs to meet the following standards:

- Separate each **logical change** into its own commit.
- Add a descriptive message for each commit. Follow
  [commit message best practices](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages).
- Document your pull requests. Include the reasoning behind each change, and
  the testing done.
- Acknowledge the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE).
